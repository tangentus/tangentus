            <h3>WebScrape API</h3>
        </fast-anchor>
        <p>
            This is still in the works in terms of direction and vision. My goal for this project is to provide a way to
            trigger customizable web-scrapes via API, or by "building" a scrape via a user-interface. Currently, the
            majority of my work has gone into the API portion.

        <h4>The "cools" and "neats"</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>😎 <b>MongoDB</b> because of its malleability. Scrapes are anything but well-defined and having a schema that can change with ease is quite a benefit.</li>
            <li>😎 Designed to be able to add scrape strategies for grabbing links, images, etc.</li>
            <li>
                🧐 Usage of Ruby's <code>>></code> operator for <code>Proc</code> objects. It passes the result of the first <code>Proc</code> to the second <code>Proc</code>
                <fast-anchor target="_blank" href="https://github.com/TangentialSolutions/web-scrape-api/blob/master/lib/service/scraper.rb#L22" appearance="stealth">Used here!</fast-anchor>
            </li>
            <li>
                🧐 A pattern for fetching and parsing websites in a way that allows for composition. The <code>fetchable</code>
                and <code>parsable</code> <code>Concerns</code> give access to their logic via a <code>Proc</code>. This
                allows it to be passed around and applied with ease, and makes it easy to use function composition with
                the <code> >> </code> operator aforementioned.

                🧐 Resque as the ActiveJob background job processor. As it stands, it is fairly dumb. But being able to offload
                larger scrapes was important from the get-go.
