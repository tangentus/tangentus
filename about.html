                My name is Trevor, some call me Trev. I have a wife, two beautiful sons; one in heaven watching over us, and one
                that blesses us everyday that he breathes. The most important thing about me is my Christian Faith.
            </p>

                Some of my hobbies include longboarding, guitar, making my son laugh, making my wife laugh, and pretty much any
                adventure you have in mind.

                I am a passionate engineer looking to make an impact on technology teams around the world. I discourage doing
                anything "just for the sake of doing it" and lean hard into finding a deeper meaning in all tasks that I work on.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Its always been that way" is a trigger for me, but it is also a weakness. I get caught wanting "normal" because it
                is easy. That weakness feeds by need to deconstruct and disrupt processes, technologies, people, places, and projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not just to break things, though. But to provide fresh and inventive ways of solving the "its always been that way"'s
                of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
               I am also starting my own business/culture/endeavor which aims to bring bright engineers together to build
                solutions that are <i>tangential</i> to modern practices.
