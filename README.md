# About Me

### Personal

My name is Trevor, some call me Trev. I have a wife, two beautiful sons; one in heaven watching over us, and one that blesses us everyday that he breathes. The most important thing about me is my Christian Faith.

### Professional

I am a passionate engineer looking to make an impact on technology teams around the world. I discourage doing anything "just for the sake of doing it" and lean hard into finding a deeper meaning in all tasks that I work on. "Its always been that way" is a trigger for me, but it is also a weakness. I get caught wanting "normal" because it is easy. That weakness feeds by need to deconstruct and disrupt processes, technologies, people, places, and projects. Not just to break things, though. But to provide fresh and inventive ways of solving the "its always been that way"'s of the world.

### Projects

- [WebScrape API](https://github.com/TangentialSolutions/web-scrape-api)

  This is still in the works in terms of direction and vision. My goal for this project is to provide a way to trigger customizable web-scrapes via API, or by "building" a scrape via a user-interface. Currently, the majority of my work has gone into the API portion.

  - The "cools" and "neats":
    - **cool**  **MongoDB** because of its malleability. Scrapes are anything but well-defined and having a ever-changing schema is quite the benefit.
    - **cool** Designed to be able to add scrape strategies for grabbing links, images, etc.
    - **neat** Usage of Ruby's `>>` operator for `Proc` objects. It passes the result of the first `Proc` to the second `Proc`
      - [Usage here](https://github.com/TangentialSolutions/web-scrape-api/blob/master/lib/service/scraper.rb#L22)
